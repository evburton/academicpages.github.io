I am a Master's of Library and Information Studies student at the University of Alabama, expected to graduate in 2020 with a specialization in Public Libraries. I am currently located in Huntsville, AL, but I received my bachelor's degree in English from Transylvania University in Lexington, KY. My professional interets are social justice and community engagement work within libraries, library marketing, and library services for historically underserved groups. I hope to work in a public library once I recieve my degree.

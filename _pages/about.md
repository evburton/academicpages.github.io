Hello! I am an MLIS-accredited librarian living in Houston, TX. I graduated in 2020 with a specialization in Public Libraries from the University of Alabama. I received my bachelor's degree in English from Transylvania University in Lexington, KY in 2016. My professional interests are social justice and community engagement work within libraries, adult services, library marketing, and library services for historically underserved groups. I have professional experience working in both public and academic libraries.

</p>Throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, I was given the opportunity to adapt library programming into the digital space for the LSC-Tomball Community Library branch of the Harris County Public Library. I have included links on this page to a few of the programs I am most proud of.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDSzxRP0jZg">Baking Is Making: Saintly Spice Cookies</a></b>- Baking Is Making was a program that I developed that blended reader's advisory, history, and culinary education by discussing notable foods throughout history. They included historical information, cooking demonstrations, and book recommendations. This episode discussed the life and culinary impact of St. Hildegard of Bingen.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAETPefWLHo">Screen Shots: Female Filmmakers</a></b>- Screen Shots was a program that highlighted materials in our audiovisual collection, including physical DVD's and Blu-Rays, as well as streaming video through Kanopy and Overdrive. The episodes were typically themed, with this one in particular highlighting films in our collection that were made by female filmmakers to celebrate Women's History Month.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVTaKC82Enw&t=767s">Live at Lunch: The History of the 1960's in 6 Books</a></b>-Live at Lunch was a systemwide collaborative virtual program that highlighted programming and staff from across the HCPL system. As part of our centennial celebration in 2021, we highlighted materials from each decade of HCPL's history. In this video, I discuss and read from one of my favorite books of the decade, Jorge Luis Borges's "Labyrinths."</p>
